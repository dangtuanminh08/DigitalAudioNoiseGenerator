#### Dev Info 
- My phone: Google Pixel 4a
- Java Version: 8
- If you're trying to clone this repository and/or get the app on your phone, I suggest using/learning about [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4cS-BhDGARIsABg4_J1JtKwOxSEJL3cfLVYuusIUK5HGLVv_I9vWDQpqSgQJ-NFhvGGysO8aAizDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
- Please ignore all warnings/TODOs. They are not harmful and the app runs as intended. I will deal with them once the whole app is complete.
