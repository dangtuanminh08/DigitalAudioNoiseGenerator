## Digital Audio/Noise Generator! (DANG!) 📼
This project is an Android app that is programmed to play audio files--specifically music.\
I made this for myself because I really hate ads on other audio players.

#### Dev Updates:
Hello!\
I stumbled into a huge problem while trying to implement a custom button into the media notification controller.\
Turns out I was using an old method of doing it. So... when I tried to use the newer method, I learned that\
most of the things I was doing manually can be easily done with Jetpack Media3 provided by Android.\
However, most of these things (such as the notification controller) are exclusive to newer versions of Android.\
Therefore, I have chosen to make two branches: one implementing Jetpack Media3 ("jetpack"), and one without ("main").\
The main branch will be updated first by the end of April.\
Unfortunately, the future of this project remains unknown past that... I need to start a big project soon to stand out for univerity applications.\
I will try to grind it out for you guys!!

#### Dev Info 
- My phone: Google Pixel 4a

- If you're trying to clone this repository and/or get the app on your phone, I suggest using/learning about [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4cS-BhDGARIsABg4_J1JtKwOxSEJL3cfLVYuusIUK5HGLVv_I9vWDQpqSgQJ-NFhvGGysO8aAizDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
- All warnings/TODOs can safely be ignored. They are not harmful and the app runs as intended. I will deal with them once the whole app is complete.
