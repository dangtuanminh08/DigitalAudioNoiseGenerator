## Digital Audio/Noise Generator! (DANG!) 📼
This project is an Android app that is programmed to play audio files--specifically music.\
I made this for myself because I really hate ads on other audio players.

### Current Features ‼️‼️

- Shuffle modes
- Cool animated Hello Kitty play/pause button!!!

### Features Coming Soon 😼
- Pitch/Speed setting
- Headphone/earbud gesture compatability
- Notification with controls
- Change names of/delete files
- More Hello Kitty...

#### Dev Updates:
HEY!!! Sorry for the lack of update! I have been very busy with FRC (proud to be on Team 6632) for the past few weeks.\
However, last week, I came back to the code, read it, and I finally realized how stupid the code was.\
So now I've been LOCKED IN, deep in the trenches, redoing... literally everything. This time, following the MVVM architecture (model-view-viewmodel). Everything should be easier for me to understand and build on... and for you too!\
Expect the rewrite **mid to late April.**

>Updated Apr 7th 2025\
>P.S. If someone knows anywhere else that's better to put these kind of updates/blogs, please let me know...

#### Dev Info 
- My phone: Google Pixel 4a
- Java Version: 8
- If you're trying to clone this repository and/or get the app on your phone, I suggest using/learning about [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4cS-BhDGARIsABg4_J1JtKwOxSEJL3cfLVYuusIUK5HGLVv_I9vWDQpqSgQJ-NFhvGGysO8aAizDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
- Please ignore all warnings/TODOs. They are not harmful and the app runs as intended. I will deal with them once the whole app is complete.
