## Digital Audio/Noise Generator! (DANG!) 📼
This project is a simple, ad-less Android app for playing audio files completely offline.\
This app is designed for myself, but you can easily customize it to your liking! (tutorial for that soon)

### Current Features ⚙️
- Cool animated Hello Kitty play/pause button!!!
- Pitch/Speed setting
- Notification controller
- Headphone gesture compatability
- Change names of/delete files

### Notes 📝
- Because this app was made for my own personal use, there are features "missing" that I don't really find important (ex. artist names)
- I will update this project sparsley while I work on other things
